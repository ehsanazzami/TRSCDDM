If you are struggling, consider reaching out to a qualified health professional.</em></p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>1. Optimize your sleep.</strong></p>\n  <p>Aim for around 7–9 hours of sleep per night and try to keep a consistent sleep schedule. Research in middle- and older-aged adults suggests that sleeping for about 7 hours per night, and avoiding both very short and very long sleep, is linked to better cognitive performance and mental health than sleeping much less or much more.¹</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>2. Reset with 5 minutes of breathing.</strong></p>\n  <p>Slow, paced breathing, where your exhale lasts slightly longer than your inhale, may reduce stress and improve mood. About 5 minutes a day of structured breathing has been shown to improve mood and decrease physiological arousal.²</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>3. Move more, even a little.</strong></p>\n  <p>Regular physical activity is linked to a lower risk of developing depression. Even small amounts of movement, below standard exercise guidelines, are associated with meaningful mental-health benefits compared with doing no activity.³</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>4. Get outside.</strong></p>\n  <p>Spending time in natural environments, even a nearby park, is linked to better self-reported health and well-being. People who spend roughly 2 hours per week in nature report better overall health and higher well-being than those who do not.⁴</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>5. Seek morning light.</strong></p>\n  <p>Getting natural light in the morning helps regulate your internal body clock, which supports healthier sleep patterns and may also improve mood. Try opening your curtains shortly after waking, stepping outside for a few minutes, or taking a brief morning walk.⁵</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>6. Hum or sing to self-soothe.</strong></p>\n  <p>Gentle humming or soft vocalization can influence heart-rate variability in ways that support relaxation. Try humming when you feel stressed or as part of a wind-down routine before bed.⁶</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>7. Laugh (seriously).</strong></p>\n  <p>Laughter can reduce stress-related physiological responses and support better mood, social connection, and overall well-being.⁷</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>8. Try expressive writing.</strong></p>\n  <p>Spending about 15–20 minutes writing privately about your thoughts and feelings can reduce emotional burden and contribute to mental and physical health improvements over time.⁸ Write for yourself, with no pressure to edit or share.</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>9. Declutter one small space.</strong></p>\n  <p>Cluttered home environments are associated with higher stress and more negative mood. Tidying a small area, like a shelf, drawer, or corner of your desk, may help create a greater sense of calm and control. Start very small if the task feels overwhelming.⁹</p>\n\n  <br><p><strong>10. Do a small act of kindness.</strong></p>\n  <p>Doing something kind for someone else, even anonymously, can boost mood and increase feelings of social connection. Acts of kindness have been shown to improve well-being and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.¹⁰</p>\n\n  <br><h6>Please Continue...</h4>\n  <p style=\"margin-top: 16px;\">\n     You will be able to download these tips as a PDF and <strong>enter the gift-card raffle</strong> once you complete the rest of the study.

We are particularly interested in how experiences with reliable or unreliable authorities, as well as perceptions of peer cooperation, shape decisions in shared-resource settings.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nTo examine these questions accurately, some parts of the study involved intentional concealment or simulation. The well-being tips PDF you encountered earlier was used to create a reliable or unreliable authority experience, depending on the condition you were assigned to. This small manipulation was designed to explore how even minor reliability cues can influence later judgments and behavior.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThe information you viewed about the other members in your group during the Public Goods Game was also simulated. The group member IDs and token allocations were pre-generated so that every participant within a given condition would encounter the same pattern of peer behavior. This approach helps us understand how people respond to group dynamics while keeping the experience consistent for all participants.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nYou were also given the option to assign costly punishment within the game. Although the decision was described realistically, no real participants were affected, and no actual payouts or consequences occurred outside of the simulated task environment.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThese forms of mild deception are commonly used in behavioral research when full transparency would alter how people behave. All procedures, including the use of simulated group members and reliability variations, were reviewed and approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board to ensure ethical standards are met.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nIf you would like to download a personal copy of the well-being tips referenced earlier, you may do so here:\n<a href=\"https://cnsuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/15555_cnsu_edu/IQAJF9pNQyt1SK9HHPY4O24EAbZD81xEvmxEChjVFyMpjnA?e=gYWZuf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the Well-Being Tips PDF</a>.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nThere are no right or wrong responses in this study. Your decisions reflect meaningful reactions to uncertainty, trust, and cooperation, which are exactly what we aim to understand. If you have any questions about the study’s purpose, procedures, or findings, you are welcome to ask now or contact the research team using the information provided.\n</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\nAs promised, you will now have the opportunity to <strong>enter the raffle</strong> for a chance to win a <strong>$100 gift card or one of two $50 gift cards</strong>. <br><br>Please <strong>continue</strong> to the next page for details.\n</p>\n"
